        <p><em>I grew up in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. In 2014 I graduated from University of Colorado Boulder with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies. Since then I have travelled around the world and back. I backpacked around Europe with some great friends from college. We Visited 12 different countries in four months, living in and out of hostels and strangers houses while moving from city to city by bus, plane, car, train and ferry. We travelled through the entirity of the Balkans by bus. From Croatia to Turkey, we stopped in many different cities along the way. I returned home after ending our trip in Istanbul. I hugged my mom and crashed in her basement for two weeks, then fled the country again, this time heading South. I lived in Sydney, Australia for 4 months and travelled through Thailand and Indonesia. After all my funds were exhausted I returned home to good ol' Boulder, CO and went back to my job at the local sushi restaurant. I made good money as a waitress, especially during karaoke night, but, I knew the food industry would not provide me with a real career. I have always been creatively inclined and I would like to make webpages for a living. So I'm here.</em></p>
